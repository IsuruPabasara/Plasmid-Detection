Episomes are plasmid present in bacterial cells that can exist independently in the cell or integrated to the main chromosome.
Escherichia coli strain ATCC 43889 has a plasmid, Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. Sakai plasmid pOSAK1.
This project will focus on aligning this plasmid with the main chromosome. This gives an idea
where plasmid DNA would be found inside the genome, if any.
